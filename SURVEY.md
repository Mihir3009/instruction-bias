#### Instructions for generating data instances (with examples)

In this task, you will look at paragraphs that contain several phrases that are references to names of people, places, or things. You will notice that multiple phrases often refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that you would ask a person to see if they understood that the phrases refer to the same entity. We want you to avoid questions that can be answered correctly by someone without actually understanding the paragraph.

Example:

Passage: Nearing London, Oliver encounters Jack Dawkins, a pickpocket more commonly known by the nickname the "Artful Dodger", and his sidekick, a boy of a humorous nature named Charley Bates, but Oliver's innocent and trusting nature fails to see any dishonesty in their actions. The Dodger provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will "give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows the Dodger to the "old gentleman's" residence. In this way Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs.

Questions:

1. Who believes Fagin's gang make wallets and handkerchiefs?
2. What is the alias of the person whose sidekick had a humorous nature?
3. What are the names of the people whose dishonesty Oliver failed to see?
4. What is the Dodger's real name?
5. What is the real name of the person who provided Oliver with a free meal?
6. Which place served as Fagin and his gang's lair?
7. Where is the old gentleman's residence?
